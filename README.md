#  LFSR-Based Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) with RAM Storage
Overview
This project implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in Verilog. The generated random numbers are stored in RAM, exported to a text file (TXT), and analyzed for uniqueness.

#  Features
âœ… LFSR-based PRNG: Generates (2^n)-1 unique random numbers before repeating.
âœ… Clock-based reseeding: Ensures variation by seeding from a counter.
âœ… RAM Storage: Stores generated numbers for analysis.
âœ… Text File Export: Saves generated numbers for external use.
âœ… Data Validation: Checks for duplicate numbers in RAM.

#  Project Structure
lfsr_trng.sv â†’ LFSR-based random number generator.
clock_counter.sv â†’ Clock-based counter for reseeding.
RAM.sv â†’ Memory storage for random numbers.
tb_lfsr_trng.sv â†’ Testbench for verification and logging.
#  How It Works
The LFSR module generates random numbers based on a feedback polynomial.
The clock counter provides an initial seed for LFSR after exhaustion of (2^n)-1 states.
Generated numbers are written to RAM and exported to a TXT file.
The testbench reads, displays, and validates data for uniqueness.
#  Usage
ðŸ”¹ Run the simulation in Vivado/ModelSim/QuestaSim.
ðŸ”¹ Check random_data.txt for generated numbers.
ðŸ”¹ Analyze data distribution in Excel/Python.
